# Kaitlyn's Kitchen Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Kaitlyn's Kitchen, a bespoke bakery website showcasing artisanal baking from the heart of San Jose, California. Our site features a vibrant display of our baked goods, information about our baking workshops, and our latest specials. My inspiration for this website was to create a template of a business website for my little sister, Kaitlyn, who loves to bake.
